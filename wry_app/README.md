# An example of using `tao`, `wry`, and `axum` to create a Tauri-like application

This example has been created to demonstrate how `tao`, `wry`, and `axum` can be used together to create a Tauri-like application that does not require installation. This is a proof of concept and is not intended to be a full replacement for Tauri.
