# Tauriless

Run a Tauri-like application without installation.

## Warning

This workspace is a temporary solution to the problem of running Tauri-like applications without installation. It is not a replacement for Tauri, and it is not a long-term solution. It is a workaround for the time being. Also, a small API breakage is expected soon.
